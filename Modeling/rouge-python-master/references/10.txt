Google announced today that it will begin running tests of a new way to deliver search results to mobile users with slow connections. The company’s pilot trials will initially take place in Indonesia, a country where the Internet is playing a greater role in people’s lives – especially among younger users – but is still plagued by slow mobile connection speeds, which average around 2.0 Mbps. With Google’s page optimization technology, however, the company says it’s able to load pages four times faster.
