algorithms that can appropriately handle mixed datatypes some possibilities datecreated t url share upvotecount text k means goal is to reduce the within cluster variance and because it computes the

standard k means algorithm isn t directly applicable to categorical data for various reasons the sample space for categorical data is discrete and doesn t have a natural origin a euclidean datecreated t url share upvotecount text in my opinion there are solutions to deal with categorical data in clustering r comes with a specific distance for categorical data this distance is called gower http www rdocumentation org p datecreated t url share upvotecount text in addition to the excellent answer by tim goodman the choice of k modes is definitely the way to go for stability of the clustering algorithm used the clustering algorithm is free to choose datecreated t url share upvotecount text this question seems really about representation and not so much about clustering categorical data is a problem for most algorithms in machine learning suppose for example you have some datecreated t url share upvotecount text you can also give the expectation maximization clustering algorithm a try it can work on categorical data and will give you a statistical likelihood of which categorical value or values datecreated t url share upvotecount text it depends on your categorical variable being used for ordinal variables say like bad average and good it makes sense just to use one variable and have values and distances make sense datecreated t url share upvotecount text you should not use k means clustering on a dataset containing mixed datatypes rather there are a number of clustering algorithms that can appropriately handle mixed datatypes some possibilities datecreated t url share upvotecount text k means goal is to reduce the within cluster variance and because it computes the centroids as the mean point of a cluster it is required to use the euclidean distance in order to converge datecreated t url share upvotecount text if we consider a scenario where the categorical variable cannot be hot encoded like the categorical variable has categories in such cases you can use a package clustmixtype it can handle datecreated t url share upvotecount text many of the above pointed that k means can be implemented on variables which are categorical and continuous which is wrong and the results need to be taken with a pinch of salt as mentioned datecreated t url share upvotecount text mixture models can be used to cluster a data set composed of continuous and categorical

in machine learning suppose for example you have some datecreated t url share upvotecount text you can also give the expectation maximization clustering algorithm a try it can work on categorical data

containing mixed datatypes rather there are a number of clustering algorithms that can appropriately handle mixed datatypes some possibilities datecreated t url share upvotecount text k means goal is to reduce the within cluster variance and because it computes the centroids as the mean point of a cluster it is required to use the euclidean distance in order to converge datecreated t url share
