Hollywood,"will recognize names like Abbey Road, Electric Lady, and Motown as places where The Beatles, Jimi Hendrix, Diana Ross, and the Supremes left their musical marks."
Hollywood,"Since then, an impressive list of rock, pop, country, and reggae artists — Aerosmith, Britney Spears, Keith Urban, and Damian Marley to name a few — have followed suit."
Hollywood,"Around 1905, “Nickelodeons”, or 5-cent movie theaters, began to offer an easy and inexpensive way for the public to watch movies. Nickelodeons helped the movie industry move into the 1920’s by increasing the public appeal of film and generate more money for filmmakers, alongside the widespread use of theaters to screen World War I propaganda. "
Hollywood,"Other moviemakers arrived from Europe after World War I: directors like Ernst Lubitsch, Alfred Hitchcock, Fritz Lang and Jean Renoir; and actors like Rudolph Valentino, Marlene Dietrich, Ronald Colman, and Charles Boyer. They joined a homegrown supply of actors — lured west from the New York City stage after the introduction of sound films — to form one of the 20th century's most remarkable growth industries. At motion pictures' height of popularity in the mid-1940s, the studios were cranking out a total of about 400 movies a year, seen by an audience of 90 million Americans per week."
Hollywood,"At the same time, one could usually guess which studio made which film, largely because of the actors who appeared in it; MGM, for example, claimed it had contracted ""more stars than there are in heaven."" Each studio had its own style and characteristic touches which made it possible to know this – a trait that does not exist today."
Hollywood,"Movie-making was still a business, however, and motion picture companies made money by operating under the studio system. The major studios kept thousands of people on salary — actors, producers, directors, writers, stunt men, craftspersons, and technicians."
Hollywood,"The Supreme Court eventually ruled that the major studios ownership of theaters and film distribution was a violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act. As a result, the studios began to release actors and technical staff from their contracts with the studios."
Hollywood,The drive to produce a spectacle on the movie screen has largely shaped American cinema ever since.
Hollywood,The first impression from those quotes is to assume that Russo is talking about future MCU films such as the second part of Infinity War not being constrained by the idea that films more than two hours are too long for audiences.
Hollywood,"Could it be only a few years until the Russo Brothers names are appearing as “executive producer” above a slew of Oscar nominees, even as they continue to direct some of the most popular blockbusters in recent memory? We’ll see if the AGBO experiment pans out."
Hollywood,"To his credit, Weinstein eventually made good on his promise. Following a widely reported sexual harassment scandal, in 2018 The Weinstein Company declared bankruptcy."
Hollywood,"Six people were arrested Thursday and one was arrested Friday after a grand jury indicted them on a variety of election fraud charges. They face accusations of bribing voters, improperly helping people fill out absentee ballots, voting despite being convicted of disqualifying felonies, and voting even though they lived outside the city or voting district."
Hollywood,"In view of all this, it should come as no surprise that there’s already a film in development about what was perhaps the biggest story in journalism this past year: the New York Times’ investigation into allegations of decades-long sexual abuse against Harvey Weinstein."
Hollywood,"According to a report in Mumbai Mirror, Lawrence Kasanoff, who is the producer of the Mortal Kombat series, made a quiet visit to Mumbai to meet Tiger and discuss details of the project. It is expected to be an action film. Lawrence, along with a big studio head and Emmy Award-winning writer Sean Catherine Derek of the Batman series came to Mumbai. Sanjay Grover, son of veteran actor Gulshan Grover, who has been part of the project for the last one year, was also part of the meetings, the report added."
Hollywood,"The foremost example of this M.O.: 2012’s Argo. In the late ’90s, the producer had read the then-recently declassified testimony of CIA exfiltration expert Tony Mendez in a CIA journal, detailing how he helped American diplomats escape the 1979 Iran hostage crisis by posing them as a group of Canadian filmmakers."

Hollywood,"This movie was not supposed to be good. Here’s the plot: A middle-aged cardiovascular surgeon’s wife is killed by a one-armed man, and said surgeon is sent to death row. But his bus crashes on the way to prison, then a train crashes into the bus crash, then Dr. Richard Kimble escapes to go on the run with five U.S. marshals on his heels. This is literally the opening 20 minutes of The Fugitive."
Hollywood,"One, prominent among Asian immigrant communities, argues that the movie marks a breakthrough in Asian representation by virtue of its all-Asian cast, and holds the promise of further representation."
Hollywood,"The ceremony will feature presentations, performances, and a special achievement award. Past honorees include Diane Warren, Smokey Robinson, and Glen Campbell."
Hollywood,"No matter how high it is, a quote is a number that an actor’s representation is constantly trying to jack up—a never-ending cache of money and extras to be forever bested. “Agents build quotes and fight for things in each successful deal that then become bedrock,” says one veteran producer. This is also how agents, who skim 10 percent of their clients’ takes, earn more themselves."
Hollywood,"“One of the most exciting aspects of our Fox acquisition is that it will allow us to greatly accelerate our direct-to-consumer strategy,” Mr. Iger said when he announced the deal in December. “We believe creating a direct-to-consumer relationship is vital to the future of our media businesses, and it’s our highest priority.”"

Hollywood,"“Spacey’s conduct was extreme and outrageous,” says the filing of yesterday, which is well within the statute of limitations that have stymied many of these types of cases in the now #MeToo era."
Hollywood,"“I was completely shocked by how little dialogue there was in the film,” Mr. Haynes said in a phone interview."
Hollywood,"Male actors command about twice the screen time of female ones. Men are the heroes and villains and do most of the talking, with (at the last count) two-thirds of speaking parts in successful films, a ratio only slightly better than in the late 1940s. Women, still, are often ornaments or victims, love interests or damsels in distress: useful for being disrobed, attacked or both."
Hollywood,"“For a guy who always had control over actors, filmmakers, his company, his family—everybody—this was the first time I saw that he couldn’t control a situation.” Even so, Weinstein seemed hell-bent on trying."
Hollywood,Sorry to Bother You: is this the most shocking anti-capitalist film ever?
Hollywood,"No, you’re not seeing double. These beautiful stars all have daughters who look just like them. From Kelly Ripa and Lola Consuelos, to Catherine Zeta-Jones and Carys Douglas, the resemblance between these duos is uncanny!"
Hollywood,"Lady Gaga surprised the small crowd at the Black Rabbit Rose venue in Hollywood, California Thursday with a performance of Frank Sinatra songs. “I’m here to ruin the party. I’m so sorry,” Gaga quipped."
Hollywood,"Rising from the ashes of the 1929 stock-market crash, Twentieth Century-Fox was forged in a master stroke by ruthless producer Darryl F. Zanuck, who merged Twentieth Century Pictures with William Fox’s ailing studio—and booted out Fox in the process—to create a formidable Hollywood player. It was the studio that turned Marilyn Monroe into a star, awarded Elizabeth Taylor her first $1 million payday (for the costly Cleopatra, which at $44 million nearly capsized the company), and helped solidify the modern-day blockbuster with George Lucas’s space fantasy, Star Wars."
Hollywood,"Triple Frontier is a good movie. The J.C. Chandor-directed action melodrama, penned by Mark Boal and starring Ben Affleck, Oscar Isaac, Garrett Hedland, Charlie Hunnam and Pedro Pascal, isn’t a new genre classic or a towering artistic achievement. It starts better than it ends, and it seems somewhat unwilling to truly confront the morality of its story (especially after its heroes cross a line of no return), but it’s exactly what it promises."
Hollywood,"When Aunt Becky and that Desperate Housewife became ensnared in the wild Hollywood cheating scam this week, countless questions arose. What does Teri Hatcher think?

Hollywood,"Former ""Desperate Housewives"" star Felicity Huffman and actress Lori Loughlin, best known for playing Aunt Becky on ""Full House,"" are facing court appearances later this month related to allegations they participated in a college admissions cheating scheme. In the court of public opinion, however, it's hard to say whether fans and Hollywood will, as Uncle Jesse says, ""Have mercy."""
Hollywood,"Airplanes are a versatile tool in the screenwriter’s arsenal: They get characters from place to place, they can crash dramatically, they can get filled with inexplicable, profanity-inducing snakes. But they’re also kind of a nightmare to film movies in, on account of really only being designed for the one thing: Cramming as many people as possible into a little tube and hurling them into the sky, without much considerations for stuff like camera equipment and crews."
Hollywood,"Entrepreneur Mariam Shaar’s idea of using Palestinians’ national cuisine to provide hope and opportunity for refugee women has succeeded beyond her wildest dreams.
